To run the transprot calculation execute:

$ sbatch submit.slurm

A file "detailed.out" is created for each calculation. 
In order to not overwrite it, you can run:

$ cp dftb_in.hsd.drain dftb_in.hsd
$ ./../bin/dftb+negf
$ cp detailed.out detailed_drain.out
$ 
$ cp dftb_in.hsd.source dftb_in.hsd
$ ./../bin/dftb+negf
$ cp detailed.out detailed_source.out
$ 
$ cp dftb_in.hsd.device dftb_in.hsd
$ ./../bin/dftb+negf
$ cp detailed.out detailed_device.out

Drain and source computation create respectively 
shiftcont_drain.dat and shiftcont_source.dat files.
To obtain correct shiftcont files, the contact 
computations are carried out with periodic boundary conditions.
Here, the device is computed without periodic boundary conditions.
You can run these once, preferably with higher kpoints, 
and then, simply paste the shiftcont files in the folder 
where you will only run the device computation.

Remeber to generate your molecular junction with the same
contact size of the shiftcont computation.

The detailed.out files contains the Fermi energy that is 
necessary as input information for the device computation.

The local current can be computed only when the device has no 
periodicity (cluster)
To plot the local currents you can use the my_flux_custom executable.
You can find the source file in the bin/ folder.

Executing it without input file, the executable prints a little 
guide on how to use it.

$ ./../bin/my_flux_custom 

 flux -a|b 'lcurrent.dat' natoms maxneigbors [fraction width cutoff color]
  *** Modified by Alessandro Pirrotta, compiled on 2016-10-17 MacMini ***
  -a : atom currents; -b: bond currents
  natoms: number of NON-metal-atoms in flux file
          in this way only end-atom to end-atom
          local currents are plotted
  maxneighbours: neighbours considered in flux calculation
  fraction [1.0]: The arrow lengths are normalized to I_max/fraction
  width [1.0]: arrows are given a width depending on length
               arrows too long are made thicker and rescaled
  cutoff [0.02]: 2 % cut off of local current contribution
  color  ['r']: 'rb': red and blue  or 'r': only red or 'g': only green

For example, for this tutorial you can run:

$ ./../bin/my_flux_custom -b lcurrents_u.dat 16 40 1.0 0.5 0.02 rb > flux_16_40_1.0_0.5_0.02_rb.dat
