***Work in progress***

DFTB+ tutorial written by Alessandro Pirrotta

What's in it:

bin/                the executables used in the tutorial

slater_koster/      the Slater-Koster parameters used by DFTB+ in this tutorial

tut01/              geometry optimization

tut02/              plot orbitals

tut03/              cluster transport computation (without pbc)

tut04/              supercell transport computation using a patched version of DFTB+NEGF (with pbc)
