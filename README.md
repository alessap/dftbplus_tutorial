# dftbplus_tutorial

DFTB+ tutorial written by Alessandro Pirrotta
This tutorial can be used on Linux system with the Slurm Workload Manager.
Both binary files and Slater-Koster parameters are NOT included here as can be downloaded from http://dftbplus.org.

What is in it:

**tut01/** geometry optimization

**tut02/** plot orbitals

**tut03/** cluster transport computation (without periodic boundary conditions (pbc))

**tut04/** supercell transport computation using a modified version of DFTB+NEGF (with pbc)

What you should get from http://dftbplus.org :

**bin/** the executables used in the tutorial should be placed here.

**slater_koster/** the Slater-Koster parameters used by DFTB+ in this tutorial should be placed here.
