This tutorial shows how to use a modified version 
of DFTB+NEGF that allows to obtain a transport computation
on a periodic junction from a single point computation.
This allows to overcome problems such as non-convergnece or
high computational cost of the traditional NEGF method that
I have encountered several times.

Gabriele Penazzi (at the time a post-doctoral fellow at Bremen
working with Thomas Fraunheim) gave us this modified DFTB+ 
soruce code. This allows to obtain the shift file (WriteShift = Yes)
The device computation is obtained by reading this file (ReadShift = Yes)
and carrying out a TransportOnly computation.
